# Tofnd: A gRPC threshold signature scheme daemon

Tofnd is a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) server written in Rust that wraps the [tofn](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofn) threshold cryptography library.

# Setup

The gRPC protobuf file is a separate [submodule](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/grpc-protobuf/). To fetch it, please be sure that the `--recursive` flag is enabled:
```
git clone git@github.com:axelarnetwork/tofnd.git --recursive
```

`tofnd` uses the [hyperium/tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) Rust gRPC implementation, which requires:
* Rust `1.56` or greater
    ```
    $ rustup update
    ```
* `rustfmt` to tidy up the code it generates
    ```
    $ rustup component add rustfmt
    ```

`tofnd` depends on `tofn`, which needs the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
* MacOS: `brew install gmp`
* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libgmp-dev`

# Build binaries

The pipeline will build binaries for the following OS/architecures :
 
* Linux AMD64
* MacOS AMD64
* MacOS ARM64

See https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/releases

For any other OS/Architecture, binaries should be built locally.

# Running the server

```
# install tofnd at ./target/release/tofnd
$ cargo install --path . && cd ./target/release

# init tofnd
$ ./tofnd -m create

# IMPORTANT: store the content of ./.tofnd/export file at a safe, offline place, and then delete the file
$ rm ./.tofnd/export

# start tofnd daemon
$ ./tofnd
```

Terminate the server with `ctrl+C`.

## Password

By default, `tofnd` prompts for a password from stdin immediately upon launch.  This password is used to encrypt on-disk storage.  It is the responsibility of the user to keep this password safe.

Users may automate password entry as they see fit.  Some examples follow.  These examples are not necessarily secure as written---it's the responsibility of the user to secure password entry.

```
# feed password from MacOS keyring
$ security find-generic-password -a $(whoami) -s "tofnd" -w | ./tofnd

# feed password from 1password-cli
$ op get item tofnd --fields password | ./tofnd

# feed password from Pass
$ pass show tofnd | ./tofnd

# feed password from environment variable `PASSWORD`
$ echo $PASSWORD | ./tofnd

# feed password from a file `password.txt`
$ cat ./password.txt | ./tofnd
```

Sophisticated users may explicitly opt out of password entry via the `--no-password` terminal argument (see below).  In this case, on-disk storage is not secure---it is the responsibility of the user to take additional steps to secure on-disk storage.

## Command line arguments

We use [clap](https://clap.rs/) to manage command line arguments.

Users can specify:
1. Tofnd's root folder. Use `--directory` or `-d` to specify a full or a relative path. If no argument is provided, then the environment variable `TOFND_HOME` is used. If no environment variable is set either, the default `./tofnd` directory is used. 
2. The port number of the gRPC server (default is 50051).
3. The option to run in _unsafe_ mode. By default, this option is off, and safe primes are used for keygen. Use the `--unsafe` flag only for testing.
4. `mnemonic` operations for their `tofnd` instance (default is `Existing`).
For more information, see on mnemonic options, see [Mnemonic](#mnemonic).
4. The option to run in _unsafe_ mode. By default, this option is off, and safe primes are used for keygen. **Attention: Use the `--unsafe` flag only for testing**.
5. By default, `tofnd` expects a password from the standard input. Users that don't want to use passwords can use the `--no-password` flag. **Attention: Use `--no-password` only for testing .**

```

# Docker

## Setup
To setup a `tofnd` container, use the `create` mnemonic command:

```
docker-compose run -e MNEMONIC_CMD=create tofnd
```

This will initialize `tofnd`, and then exit.

## Execution

To run a `tofnd` daemon inside a container, run:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Storage

We use [data containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/) to persist data across restarts. To clean up storage, remove all `tofnd` containers, and run

```
docker volume rm tofnd_tofnd
```

## Testing

For testing purposes, `docker-compose.test.yml` is available, which is equivelent to `./tofnd --no-password --unsafe`. To spin up a test `tofnd` container, run

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
```

## The `auto` command

In containerized environments the `auto` mnemonic command can be used.  This command is implemented in `entrypoint.sh` and does the following:
1. Try to use existing mnemonic.  If successful then launch `tofnd` server.
2. Try to import a mnemonic from file.  If successful then launch `tofnd` server.
3. Create a new mnemonic.  The newly created mnemonic is automatically written to the file `TOFND_HOME/export`---rename this file to `TOFND_HOME/import` so as to unblock future executions of tofnd.  Then launch `tofnd` server.

The rationale behind `auto` is that users can frictionlessly launch and restart their tofnd nodes without the need to execute multiple commands.
`auto` is currently the default command only in `docker-compose.test.yml`, but users can edit the `docker-compose.yml` to use it at their own discretion.

**Attention:** `auto` leaves the mnemonic on plain text on disk. You should remove the `TOFND_HOME/import` file and store the mnemonic at a safe, offline place.

# Mnemonic

`Tofnd` uses the [tiny-bip39](https://docs.rs/crate/tiny-bip39/0.8.0) crate to enable users manage mnemonic passphrases. Currently, each party can use only one passphrase.

Mnemonic is used to enable _recovery_ of shares in case of unexpected loss. See more about recovery under the [Recover](#Recover) section.

## Mnemonic options

The command line API supports the following commands:

* `Existing` Starts the gRPC daemon using an existing mnemonic; Fails if no mnemonic exist.

* `Create` Creates a new mnemonic, inserts it in the kv-store, exports it to a file and exits; Fails if a mnemonic already exists.

* `Import` Prompts user to give a new mnemonic from standard input, inserts it in the kv-store and exits; Fails if a mnemonic exists or if the provided string is not a valid bip39 mnemonic.

* `Export` Writes the existing mnemonic to _<tofnd_root>/.tofnd/export_ and exits; Succeeds when there is an existing mnemonic. Fails if no mnemonic is stored, or the export file already exists.

## Zeroization

We use the [zeroize](https://docs.rs/zeroize/1.1.1/zeroize/) crate to clear sensitive info for memory as a good procatie. The data we clean are related to the mnemonic:
1. entropy
2. passwords
3. passphrases

Note that, [tiny-bip39](https://docs.rs/crate/tiny-bip39/0.8.0) also uses `zeroize` internally.

# KV Store

To persist information between different gRPCs (i.e. _keygen_ and _sign_), we use a key-value storage based on [sled](https://sled.rs/).

`Tofnd` uses two separate KV Stores:
1. `Share KV Store`. Stores all user's shares when `keygen` protocol is completed, and uses them for `sign` protocol. Default path is _./kvstore/shares_.
2. `Mnemonic KV Store`. Stores the entropy of a mnemonic passphrase. This entropy is used to encrypt and decrypt users' sensitive info, i.e. the content of the `Share KV Store`. Default path is _./kvstore/mnemonic_.

## Security

**Important note**: Currently, the `mnemonic KV Store` is **not** encrypted. The mnemonic entropy is stored in clear text on disk. Our current security model assumes secure device access.

# Multiple shares

Multiple shares are handled internally. That is, if a party has 3 shares, the `tofnd` binary spawns 3 protocol execution threads, and each thread invokes `tofn` functions independently.

When a message is received from the gRPC client, it is broadcasted to all shares. This is done in the [broadcast](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/tree/main/src/gg20/broadcast.rs) module.

At the end of the protocol, the outputs of all N party's shares are aggregated and a single result is created and sent to the client. There are separate modules [keygen result](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/tree/main/src/gg20/keygen/result.rs) and [sign result](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/tree/main/src/gg20/sign/result.rs) that handles the aggregation results for each protocol.

For `tofn` support on multiple shares, see [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofn#support-for-multiple-shares-per-party).

# gRPCs
Tofnd currently supports the following gRPCs:
1. `keygen`
2. `sign`
3. `recover`

`Keygen` and `sign` use [bidirectional streaming](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc) and `recover` is [unary](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc).

## Diagrams

See a generic protocol sequence diagram, [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/blob/main/diagrams/protocol.pdf).

See [keygen](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/blob/main/diagrams/keygen.svg) and [sign](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/blob/main/diagrams/sign.svg) diagrams of detailed message flow of each protocol. By opening the `.svg` files at a new tab (instead of previewing from github), hyperlinks will be available that will point you to the code block in which the underlying operations are implemented.

## Keygen
The _keygen_ gRPC executes the keygen protocol as implemented in [tofn](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofn) and described in [GG20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf).

The initialization of _keygen_ is actualized by the following message:

```
message KeygenInit {
    string new_key_uid;  // keygen's identifier        
    repeated string party_uids;
    repeated uint32 party_share_counts;
    int32 my_party_index;       
    int32 threshold;
}
```

### Successful keygen
On success, the _keygen_ protocol returns a `SecretKeyShare` struct defined by `tofn`
```
pub struct SecretKeyShare {
    group: GroupPublicInfo,
    share: ShareSecretInfo,
}
```

This struct includes:
1. The information that is needed by the party in order to participate in subsequent _sign_ protocols that are associated with the completed _keygen_.
2. The `public key` of the current _keygen_.

Since multiple shares per party are supported, _keygen_'s result may produce multiple `SecretKeyShare`s. The collection of `SecretKeyShare`s is stored in the `Share KV Store` as the _value_ with the `key_uid` as _key_.

Each `SecretKeyShare` is then encrypted using the party's `mnemonic`, and the encrypted data is sent to the client as bytes, along with the `public key`. We send the encrypted `SecretKeyShare`s to facilitate _recovery_ in case of data loss.

The gRPC message of _keygen_'s data is the following:
```
message KeygenOutput {
    bytes pub_key = 1;                       // pub_key
    repeated bytes share_recovery_infos = 2; // recovery info
}
```

### Unsuccessful keygen

The `tofn` library supports fault detection. That is, if a party does not follow the protocol (e.g. by corrupting zero knowledge proofs, stalling messages etc), a fault detection mechanism is triggered, and the protocol ends prematurely with all honest parties composing a faulter list.

In this case, instead of the aforementioned result, _keygen_ returns a `Vec<Faulters>`, which is sent over the gRPC stream before closing the connection.

### File structure
_Keygen_ is implemented in [tofnd/src/gg20/keygen](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/tree/main/src/gg20/keygen), which has the following file structure:

```
├── keygen
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── init.rs
    ├── execute.rs
    ├── result.rs
    └── types.rs
```

* In `mod.rs`, the handlers of protocol initialization, execution and aggregation of results are called. Also, in case of multiple shares, multiple execution threads are spawned.
* In `init.rs`, the verification and sanitization of the `Keygen Init` message is handled.
* In `execute.rs`, the instantiation and execution of the protocol is actualized.
* In `result.rs`, the results of all party shares are aggregated, validated and sent to the gRPC client.
* In `types.rs`, useful structs that are needed in the rest of the modules are defined.

## Sign
The _sign_ gRPC executes the sign protocol as implemented in [tofn](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofn) and described in [GG20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf).

The initialization of _sign_ is actualized by the following message:

```
message SignInit {
    string key_uid;     // keygen's identifier
    repeated string party_uids;
    bytes message_to_sign;
}
```

### Successful sign

On success, the _keygen_ protocol returns a `signature` which is a `Vec<u8>`.

Since multiple shares per party are supported, _sign_'s result may produce multiple `signatures`s which are the same across all shares. Only one copy of the `signature` is sent to the gRPC client.

### Unsuccessful sign

Similarly to _keygen_, if faulty parties are detected during the execution of _sign_, the protocol is stopped and a `Vec<Faulters>` is returned to the client.

### Trigger recovery

_Sign_ is started with the special gRPC message `SignInit`.
```
message SignInit {
    string key_uid = 1;
    repeated string party_uids = 2;
    bytes message_to_sign = 3;
}
```

`key_uid` indicates the session identifier of an executed _keygen_. In order to be able to participate to _sign_, parties need to have their `share` info stored at the `Share KV Store` as _value_, under the _key_ `key_uid`. If this data is not present at the machine of a party (i.e. no `key_uid` exists in `Share KV Store`), a `need_recover` gRPC message is sent to the client and the connection is then closed. In the `need_recover` message, the missing `key_uid` is included.

```
message NeedRecover {
    string session_id = 1;
}
```

The client then proceeds by triggering _recover_ gRPC, and then starts the _sign_ again for the recovered party. Other participants are not affected.

### File structure
The keygen protocol is implemented in [tofnd/src/gg20/sign](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/tree/main/src/gg20/sign), which, similar to _keygen_, has the following file structure:

```
├── sign
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── init.rs
    ├── execute.rs
    ├── result.rs
    └── types.rs
```

* In `mod.rs`, the handlers of protocol initialization, execution and aggregation of results are called. Also, in case of multiple shares, multiple execution threads are spawned.
* In `init.rs`, the verification and sanitization of `Sign Init` message is handled. If the absence of shares is discovered, the client sends a `need_recover` and stops.
* In `execute.rs`, the instantiation and execution of the protocol is actualized.
* In `result.rs`, the results of all party shares are aggregated, validated and sent to the gRPC client.
* In `types.rs`, useful structs that are needed in the rest of the modules are defined.

## Recover

As discussed in [keygen](#keygen) and [sign](#sign) section, the recovery of lost keys and shares is supported. In case of sudden data loss, for example due to a hard disk crash, parties are able to recover their shares. This is possible because each party sends it's encrypted secret info to the client before storing it inside the `Share KV Store`.

When _keygen_ is completed, the party's information is encryped and sent to the client. When the absence of party's information is detected during _sign_, `Tofnd` sends the `need_recover` message, indicating that recovery must be triggered.

Recovery is a [unary](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc) gRPC. The client re-sends the `KeygenInit` message and the encrypted recovery info. This allows `Tofnd` to reconstruct the `Share KV Store` by decrypting the recovery info using the party's `mnemonic`.

```
message RecoverRequest {
    KeygenInit keygen_init = 1;
    repeated bytes share_recovery_infos = 2;
}
```

If _recovery_ was successful, a `success` message is sent, other wise `Tofnd` sends a `fail` message.

```
message RecoverResponse {
    enum Response {
        success = 0;
        fail = 1;
    }
    Response response = 1;
}
```

# Testing

## Honest behaviours

Both unit tests and integration tests are provided:
