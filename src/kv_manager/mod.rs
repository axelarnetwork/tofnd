//! Key-Value Store service. We use [sled] for the underlying db implementation.
//! For every kvstore initialized, a daemon is spawned that serves basic
//! database functionality using the "actor" pattern ([kv::Kv] is the "handle"): https://ryhl.io/blog/actors-with-tokio/
//! See https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels for tokio channels
//! See [kv] module for the public API.
